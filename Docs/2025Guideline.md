# Detailed Project Development 

## Introduction
This document outlines a comprehensive plan for the ongoing development of EcoGo, to meet the objectives set for a masterâ€™s degree project. Building on the existing full version and extensive documentation, this plan incorporates feedback from the juries during the initial final exam to enhance the app's functionality and user experience.

## Feedback Summary
Key suggestions for EcoGo's improvement include:
1. **Display Total Carbon Emissions**: Create a feature to calculate and display the total carbon emissions for each mode of transportation (e.g., car, bus, bike).
2. **Dietary Emissions Calculation**: Introduce functionality that allows users to input dietary choices and calculates the corresponding carbon emissions.
3. **Vehicle Registration Data Fetching**: Implement a feature to fetch and integrate data using the vehicle registration number for personalized user insights.
4. **Design Optimization**: Revise the app's design to enhance user experience, focusing on usability and visual appeal.
5. **Transportation Notifications**: Develop a notification system that alerts users when alternative transportation options are available for their frequently traveled routes.
6. **User Feedback Collection**: Establish a method for gathering user feedback from multiple users to ensure a diverse range of opinions and improvements.
7. **Unit Testing**: Create unit tests to ensure compatibility with pre-defined API responses, enhancing the app's reliability and professionalism.
