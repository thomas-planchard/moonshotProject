## 1 Purpose of the Test Plan

The purpose of this test plan is to outline the testing strategy and approach of the app. 

## 2. Scope

- Application: EcoGo
- Platforms: iOS
- Technologies: React, React Native, Firebase, Google Maps API,
- Objective: Ensure the application is fully functional, user-friendly, and provides accurate CO2 consumption data across both platforms.

## 3. Objectives

- Validate the accuracy of the CO2 consumption calculations.
- Confirm the application meets performance, security, and usability standards.
- Verify seamless integration with third-party services and APIs.
- Identify and resolve any bugs or issues.

## 4. Test Items

- User authentication (Login, Register, Logout).
- User activity tracking and data input.
- CO2 consumption calculations logic and accuracy.
- UI/UX consistency and responsiveness.
- API integration and data retrieval.
- Notifications. 
- Data storage and retrieval.
- Security aspects (eg. data encryption, secure connections).
- Compatibility with various screen sizes and OS versions. 

## 5. Test Approach

### 5.1. Test Levels

- Unit Testing: Individual components and functions' logic.
- Integration Testing: Interaction between frontend and backend components.
- System Testing: End-to-end testing of the application on iOS.
- Acceptance Testing: Final testing before deployment to ensure the application meets all requirements.

### 5.3. Test Types

- Functional testing: Verify the application functions according to the requirements.
- UI/UX testing: Ensure the application is usable without any design flaws on any screen size.
- Performance testing: Evaluate the application's performance under various conditions such as low network speed or high traffic.
- Compatibility testing: Confirm the application works across different devices, screen sizes, and OS versions.
- Security testing: Identify and resolve any security vulnerabilities.
- Usability testing: Evaluate the application's ease of use and user satisfaction.
- Regression testing: Ensure new updates or features do not negatively affect existing functionality.

### 5.4. Beta Testing

- Beta testing will be conducted to gather feedback from real users before the final release.
- Beta testers will be selected from the target audience to provide valuable insights and suggestions.
- Feedback will be collected through surveys, interviews, and user testing sessions.
- Beta testing will help identify any issues or areas for improvement before the official launch.
- The goal is to get as much feedback as possible from iOS users to ensure a successful launch.

### 5.5.  Accessibility Testing
  
- Accessibility testing will be conducted to ensure the application is usable by all users, including those with disabilities.
- The application will be tested using screen readers, voice commands, and other assistive technologies.
- The goal is to ensure the application is accessible to all users and complies with accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.0. (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
