# MagestionPro Receipt Data Extraction Plan 

MagestionPro requires a system that can extract information from receipts and communicate with an external API. The external API will calculate the carbon footprint based on the provided data.

To achieve this, I propose building a Python-based Flask API. This API will:
1.	Receive a receipt in PDF as input.
2.	Extract relevant information from the receipt using scraping.
3.	Format and send the extracted data to the external API.
4.	Return the carbon footprint result back to the Symfony-based main application.

This Flask API will be designed to work seamlessly with the Symfony app, serving as a bridge between receipt data processing and carbonClap's carbon footprint calculation API.

## Workflow Overview:

1.	Symfony App:

	•	User uploads receipt or enters trip details.

	•	Calls Flask API with receipt data.

2.	Flask API:

	•	Processes receipt and extracts data.

	•	Sends formatted data to the external carbon footprint API.

	•	Returns the calculated carbon footprint to Symfony.

3.	External Carbon API:

	•	Processes input data and calculates carbon footprint.

## Possible Improvements:

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology has made significant strides, yet there are several areas where further enhancements can be pursued:

1.	Multilingual and Handwriting Recognition: Advancements in AI and machine learning are enabling OCR systems to accurately process documents in multiple languages and various handwriting styles, meeting the demands of a globalized business environment. ￼
	
2.	Integration with Natural Language Processing (NLP): Incorporating NLP into OCR systems allows for a deeper understanding of the context and semantics of the extracted text, facilitating more accurate data extraction and interpretation, particularly in complex documents such as legal contracts and financial statements. ￼

3.	Real-Time Processing and Augmented Reality (AR) Applications: The development of real-time OCR capabilities is paving the way for applications in augmented reality. For instance, users can point their devices at text in a foreign language and receive instant translations overlaid on their screen, enhancing user experience and accessibility.
 ￼
4.	Improved Accuracy through AI and Machine Learning: The integration of advanced AI algorithms and deep learning models is leading to significant improvements in OCR accuracy. These technologies enable OCR systems to better handle complex fonts, varied layouts, and degraded document quality, reducing errors and the need for manual corrections. ￼

5.	Cloud-Based OCR Solutions: The adoption of cloud-based OCR services offers scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. These solutions allow businesses to process large volumes of documents efficiently and access OCR capabilities without the need for extensive on-premises infrastructure. ￼
