# Monthly Project Report: React Native Implementation Phase - iOS App Prototype

Project: EcoGo

Duration: Month 3

## Project Overview:
The EcoGo project aims to develop an innovative application called "EcoGo" that helps users track their carbon footprint and provides personalized recommendations for eco-friendly products and services. The third month of the project marked the beginning of the React Native implementation phase with the primary objective of creating a working iOS app prototype.

## Accomplishments:

1. React Native Implementation:
   - Initiated the development process by setting up a React Native project environment.
   - Created a basic iOS app prototype with essential components to lay the foundation for the full-featured EcoGo application.
   

2. UI/UX Integration:
   - Developed initial screens and navigation paths to demonstrate the user interface and user experience concepts.

3. iOS App Prototype:
   - Built a simple but functional prototype that showcases key features like user registration, login, and navigation between screens.


## Challenges/Risks:
1. Scope Expansion: While the iOS app prototype is a valuable starting point, it's essential to ensure that the project remains focused on its core objectives and doesn't deviate from its primary goals.

## Next Steps:
1. Feature Implementation: Continue developing and expanding the iOS app prototype to include features identified in the survey and prioritized during the technology selection phase.
2. Android App Prototype: Begin the development of a parallel Android app prototype to ensure cross-platform compatibility.
3. User Testing: Engage in user testing to gather early feedback on the iOS prototype's usability and functionality.
4. Development Iterations: Iterate on the prototype based on user feedback and performance evaluations.
5. Backend Development: Advance the backend infrastructure development to support the growing functionality of the application.
6. API Integrations: Continue integrating with external APIs and services, such as transportation data and environmental impact calculators.

## Conclusion:
The third month of the EcoGo project saw the initiation of the React Native implementation phase with the development of a working iOS app prototype. This prototype, although basic, serves as a solid foundation for the more extensive feature development ahead. The integration of UI/UX designs and core functionalities demonstrates the project's progress and potential. As the project moves forward, the team remains committed to delivering a valuable and user-friendly EcoGo application.
