# Monthly Project Report: Design and Technology Selection Phase 

Project: EcoGo

The Sustainable Lifestyle Tracker project is referred to as "EcoGo." from now on.

Duration: Month 2

## Project Overview:
         
EcoGo aims to develop an innovative application that helps users track their carbon footprint and provides personalized recommendations for eco-friendly products and services. The second month of the project focused on making critical technology choices and advancing the design phase of the application.

### Accomplishments:

1.  Technology Selection: After careful evaluation of available options, the decision was made to adopt React Native as the primary framework for mobile app development. The following factors influenced this choice:

   - **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** React Native allows us to build a single codebase that can run on both iOS and Android, saving development time and resources.
   - **Community Support:** React Native boasts a large and active community, ensuring access to a wealth of libraries, plugins, and resources.
   - **Performance:** The framework's performance is highly commendable, providing a smooth user experience.
   - **Quick Development:** React Native accelerates the development process by enabling us to reuse components and logic across platforms.

2. Feature Selection:
   - An in-depth analysis of the survey data revealed the most requested and impactful features for the application, including:
     - **GPS Tracking and Mapping for Navigation:** Users expressed a strong desire for GPS-based route planning and navigation.
     - **Carbon Footprint Calculator:** This feature was deemed essential, allowing users to measure their environmental impact.
     - **Personalized Recommendations:** Users welcomed recommendations for eco-friendly transportation options.
     - **Real-Time Data on Public Transit:** Access to up-to-date information on public transit schedules and availability was highlighted as important.
     - **Integration with Carpooling Services:** Users showed interest in carpooling and ride-sharing options.

3. User Experience Design (UX):
   - The design phase of the application was initiated, focusing on creating a user interface (UI) that aligns with sustainability and offers a seamless user experience.
   - The team began developing prototypes and wireframes to visualize the app's layout and user flow.

### Challenges/Risks:
1. Design Iterations: The iterative nature of the design process required multiple rounds of feedback and refinement to ensure alignment with user expectations.

### Next Steps:
1. Frontend Development: Proceed with the implementation of the UI/UX design, transforming finalized designs into functional frontend components and screens.
2. Gather Information: Collect information on the various features of the application to facilitate implementation for the team.


### Conclusion:
The second month of EcoGo witnessed significant progress in both technology selection and design. React Native was chosen as the development framework due to its cross-platform capabilities and robust community support. Critical features were identified based on user survey data, providing a clear roadmap for development. The UX design phase has commenced, aiming to create an engaging and user-friendly interface. The project is on track and ready to advance to the development phase.
