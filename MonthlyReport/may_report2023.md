# Monthly Project Report: Research and Survey Phase 

Project: Sustainable Lifestyle Tracker: Month 1

## Project Overview:
The Sustainable Lifestyle Tracker project aims to develop an innovative application that helps users track their carbon footprint and provides personalized recommendations for eco-friendly products and services. The first month focused on conducting research and surveys to gather user preferences and determine the most desired features for the application.

## Accomplishments:

1. Research Conducted:
   - Explored existing sustainable transportation apps to identify their features and functionalities.
   - Studied user feedback and reviews of similar applications to understand user needs and pain points.
   - Researched environmental impact calculators and carbon footprint measurement methodologies.

2. Survey Development and Distribution:
   - Created a comprehensive survey to collect user preferences and opinions regarding sustainable transportation and related features.
   - Designed the survey to capture information on primary modes of transportation, concerns about carbon footprint, desired app features, barriers/challenges, and additional suggestions.
   - Distributed the survey through various channels, including online platforms and social media.
3. Survey Data Collection:
   - Received a significant number of survey responses from diverse user segments.
   - Collected data on primary modes of transportation, concerns about carbon footprint, desired app features, importance of real-time data, barriers/challenges, and additional feedback.
   - Organized and analyzed survey data to identify recurring patterns and insights.

4. Feature Identification:
   - Extracted valuable information from survey responses to identify the most desired features for the application.
   - Analyzed user preferences related to GPS tracking, carbon footprint calculations, personalized recommendations, real-time data on public transit, integration with carpooling services, and social sharing capabilities.
   - Explored the interest in additional features such as bike-sharing station information, electric vehicle charging stations, and walking routes.

## Next Steps:
1. Feature Prioritization: Analyze the survey data in more detail to identify the most requested and impactful features for the application.
2. Design and Development Planning: Based on the prioritized features, initiate the design and development planning phase to outline the technical requirements, resources, and timeline.
3. User Experience Design: Begin the user experience (UX) design process to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that align with the identified features.
4. Development Kickoff: Initiate the development phase, starting with the implementation of core features and functionalities.
5. Continuous Feedback Collection: Establish channels for ongoing user feedback to ensure the application meets users' expectations and remains aligned with their needs.

## Conclusion:
The research and survey phase of the Moonshot project has provided valuable insights into user preferences for a sustainable transportation application. The survey data analysis will inform the prioritization of features and guide the subsequent design and development phases.
