## About the project 

Welcome to EcoGo, your carbon footprint tracker! EcoGo is a mobile application designed to help individuals track their carbon emissions, make eco-friendly transportation choices, and reduce their environmental impact.

The purpose of EcoGo is to raise awareness about carbon emissions generated from transportation activities and empower users to make more sustainable travel choices. By tracking their carbon footprint in real-time, users can visualize the environmental impact of their transportation decisions and receive personalized recommendations to reduce emissions.

### Built With

* [![React-Native][React.js]][React-url]
* [![TypeScript][TypeScript.js]][TypeScript-url]
* [![Expo][Expo.js]][Expo-url]


## Features

EcoGo offers the following key features:

1. **Carbon Footprint Tracking:** Users can track their carbon emissions from various transportation modes, including walking, cycling, public transport, carpooling, and driving.
   
2. **Real-time Emission Calculation:** The app calculates carbon emissions in real time based on GPS data, distance traveled, and transportation mode.

3. **Graphical Representation:** Users can visualize their carbon footprint over time through interactive graphs, providing insights into their environmental impact.

4. **Gamification:** EcoGo gamifies the carbon footprint tracking experience by rewarding users with virtual coins for reducing their emissions. Coins can be used to unlock rewards in the in-app store.

5. **In-App Store:** The app features an in-app store where users can redeem coins for discounts and offers on eco-friendly products, carpooling services, and public transportation.

6. **Multi-language Support:** The app will be available in both English and French to cater to a diverse user base.

## Getting Started
