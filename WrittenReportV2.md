1. Meeting Documentation

Meeting 1: Initial Contact with Founder

	•	Date: October 17, 2024
	•	Attendees: User, Marguerite Blank (Founder of magestion.pro)
	•	Agenda:
	•	Introduction of both parties
	•	Presentation of User’s moonshot project
	•	Overview of magestion.pro’s activities and roadmap
	•	Summary:
	•	Marguerite presented the company’s mission: helping movie producers calculate their carbon footprint and manage their carbon expenses.
	•	Discussion on the company’s future plans, challenges, and how the user’s moonshot could potentially align with their roadmap.
	•	Follow-up:
	•	Plan for a second meeting with magestion.pro’s Product Manager on October 29, 2024.
	•	User tasked with coming up with ideas to enhance their product offering.

2. Ideas for Product Improvement

	1.	Simplifying Data Integration (SNCF Train Ticket Example):
	•	You explored simplifying the user’s data entry process for transportation and logistics bills.
	•	Started developing a feature to retrieve CO2 emissions data directly from an SNCF train ticket using their API. This would allow comparison between the emissions from a train trip versus a car trip for the same route.
	•	Plan to provide a detailed explanation of this during the next meeting.
	2.	Location “Eco-Score” System:
	•	A tool that assigns an eco-score to potential filming locations based on criteria like distance, available transportation options, and infrastructure.
	•	It would compare different locations and recommend the most eco-friendly option.
	3.	Equipment Emissions Analysis:
	•	A system to analyze the environmental impact of filming equipment (lighting, cameras, sound, etc.).
	•	The tool would suggest greener alternatives and generate a report comparing the CO2 emissions of different equipment options.
	4.	Real-Time Carbon Dashboard:
	•	Development of a real-time dashboard to track the overall carbon emissions of a film project, similar to a financial budget.
	•	The dashboard could alert the user when emissions exceed the predetermined carbon budget, providing insights for making real-time adjustments.
	5.	Promoting Virtual Collaboration:
	•	Encouraging the use of virtual collaboration tools (Zoom, Teams) during pre-production and post-production phases to minimize travel-related emissions.
	•	The tool could calculate CO2 savings from remote meetings compared to in-person ones, especially for international teams, while acknowledging the carbon footprint of virtual platforms themselves.
	6.	Total Project Emission Calculation with Compensation Options:
	•	A system to calculate the total carbon emissions of a project and propose compensation methods, such as tree planting or investing in renewable energy projects.
	•	This tool would help users clearly understand their options for offsetting unavoidable emissions.
	7.	Supplier Ranking Based on Sustainability:
	•	A knowledge-sharing system that prioritizes suppliers based on sustainable practices.
	•	The tool would rank suppliers, such as those providing special effects, transport, or costumes, based on their carbon footprint and recommend more environmentally friendly options.

3. Meeting 2: Discussion on Potential Solutions

	•	Date: October 31, 2024
	•	Attendees: User, Marguerite Blank (Founder of magestion.pro)
	•	Agenda:
	•	Review of ideas for product improvements
	•	Discussion on potential solutions and project direction
	•	Planning next steps
	•	Summary:
	•	The meeting was held without the Product Manager due to an internal issue within the company.
	•	Discussed various potential solutions to enhance the product offering.
	•	Reached an agreement to work on developing a feature that involves scraping data from receipts. This data would then be sent to Carbon Clap, a carbon calculator, to streamline the process of calculating carbon emissions.
	•	The proposed solution aims to simplify data entry for users and improve the accuracy of carbon footprint calculations.
	•	Follow-up:
	•	Plan to schedule a meeting with Franck Jeannin to ensure the project aligns with the requirements for the final degree.
	•	Prepare necessary documentation to present the project’s feasibility and alignment with academic expectations.
