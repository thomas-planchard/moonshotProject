# First Project

My first idea for the moonshot project was to create an application with a built-in ai so that I could play a game of bowling with anyone in the world who had the application.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create an application that allows users to play a game of bowling with others around the world using built-in AI, while also serving as a social network. The application will include features such as account creation, private messaging, and user bios.

Users will be able to create an account with the application and create a profile with their personal information, including a profile picture, bio, and other relevant information. They will also be able to search for other users and connect with them, sending private messages and creating friend lists.

The primary focus of the application will be the built-in AI that allows users to play a game of bowling with others around the world. The AI will be able to recognise the score of the user when they play in real life, by placing their phone in front of the pins. The AI will track the score and write it in the application, allowing users to keep track of their performance.

The AI component of the application will utilise computer vision algorithms to recognise the position of the pins and the trajectory of the ball in real-time. It will use this information to calculate the score and update the application accordingly.

Overall, this application aims to provide a fun and engaging platform for users to play a game of bowling while also connecting with other users from around the world. With the inclusion of social networking features and the innovative use of AI, users will be able to build connections, foster a sense of community within the application, and enjoy a realistic bowling experience.


## Project Goals/Objectives

- To create a user-friendly application that allows users to play a game of bowling with others around the world, while also serving as a social network.

- To develop and implement a built-in AI that recognises the score of the user when they play in real life, and updates the application accordingly.

- To utilise computer vision algorithms to recognise the position of the pins and the trajectory of the ball in real-time, and use this information to calculate the score.

- To develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate the application, create an account, and connect with other users.

- To foster a sense of community within the application, by providing social networking features such as private messaging and friend lists.

- To provide users with a realistic bowling experience, and allow them to improve their skills and track their performance over time.

- To continuously improve the application based on user feedback and provide updates and new features to keep users engaged.

## Project Scope

The scope of this project includes the development of an application that allows users to play a game of bowling with others around the world using a built-in AI, while also serving as a social network. The application will include the following features:

- **Account Creation:** Users will be able to create an account with the application, which will include their personal information such as name, email address, and profile picture.

- **Social Networking:** The application will allow users to connect with others and build a community within the application, through private messaging and friend lists.

- **Bowling Game:** The primary focus of the application will be the built-in AI that allows users to play a game of bowling with others around the world. The AI will be able to recognise the score of the user when they play in real life and update the application accordingly.

- **Computer Vision Algorithms:** The AI component of the application will utilise computer vision algorithms to recognise the position of the pins and the trajectory of the ball in real-time, and use this information to calculate the score.

- **User Interface:** The application will have a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate the application, create an account, and connect with other users.

- **Realistic Bowling Experience:** The application will provide users with a realistic bowling experience, allowing them to improve their skills and track their performance over time.

- **Continuous Improvement:** The application will be continuously improved based on user feedback, providing updates and new features to keep users engaged.

The project will be developed for both Android and iOS platforms, using programming languages such as Java and Swift. The application will be tested on different devices to ensure its compatibility and performance. The scope of the project may be adjusted based on the development progress and resources available.


## Project Challenges/Risks

- **Technical challenges:** The application relies heavily on complex technologies such as AI, machine learning, and image recognition, which could pose technical challenges and may require extensive testing and debugging.

- **User adoption:** The application's success largely depends on user adoption and engagement. Without a large user base, it may be challenging to generate sufficient revenue to sustain the project.

- **Limited resources:** The development team is composed of 1 person and may have limited resources in terms of budget, time, and expertise. This could potentially affect the quality and functionality of the application, as well as its ability to compete with other similar applications in the market.

- **Legal and privacy concerns:** The application will involve collecting and processing user data, which could potentially raise legal and privacy concerns. It's important to ensure that the application complies with relevant regulations and that user data is collected and processed in a secure and ethical manner.

- **Competitors:** The market for social networking and gaming applications is highly competitive, and there may be similar applications already available in the market. The development team will need to identify and address any weaknesses or gaps in the market to make the application stand out.

- **Changing user preferences:** User preferences and trends may change over time, which could potentially affect the demand for the application. The development team will need to be flexible and adapt the application to changing user needs and preferences.

- **Technical limitations:** The application relies on the user's phone being positioned correctly in front of the pins to accurately calculate the score. However, due to technical limitations, the application may not be able to accurately calculate the score in all scenarios, which could lead to user dissatisfaction.






## Project Budget

## Project Timeline

- June 2022: Brainstorming and Ideation

  - Brainstorming and coming up with the idea for the application with built-in AI and social networking features.
<hr>

- July-August 2022: Research and Learning

  - Conducting research on how to build the application, including learning Swift programming language, developing a Python script to calculate the score in bowling, and creating a graphic chart. (cf. First_research Folder)
<hr>


- October 2022: Feedback and Adjustments

  - Pitching the project in front of juries and receiving feedback to add more technologies to the project.
  - Conducting further research on how to add more technologies and sensors to the application, but ultimately determining that it is not feasible to do so in a short period of time.
<hr>

- November-January 2022: Research

  - Conducting research on how to incorporate additional technologies, such as sensors or other input devices, if feasible and within the project scope.

<hr>

- February 2023: Future Planning
  - Abandonment of the project because after a lot of research it is impossible to add technology to the project
  - Conducting research on new project ideas and exploring other areas of interest.
